# Kids Learn The World

Kids Learn the World is an iOS application developed in 2018 with Swift and the SpriteKit framework. It was developed for children aged 0 to 4 years approximately with the intention of having their first contact with the world: Learning sounds, notions of causality and words with different environments that everything is touchable and responds with actions.

## Scenes

The app has 4 scenes: Sky scene (Day and Night), Sea scene (Day and Night), Garden scene and Mars scene (accessed touching the moon in the sky scene). Every scene has some elements that are touchable and responds with an animation or sound.

Moreover, every scene has a simple game that the user can play.
